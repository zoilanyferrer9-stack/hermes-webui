"""Regression tests for v0.50.259 — SessionDB FD leak fixes from PR #1421
plus Opus pre-release advisor follow-up extending the fix to LRU eviction.

The bug: `_run_agent_streaming` created a new `SessionDB` per request and
replaced the cached agent's `_session_db` without closing the old one.
After ~73 messages on a long-lived agent, leaked FDs exhausted the 256 FD
default limit causing `EMFILE` crashes.

Fix path 1 (PR #1421 by @wali-reheman): close `agent._session_db` before
replacing it on the cached-agent reuse path.

Fix path 2 (this PR Opus follow-up): same shape on the LRU eviction path.
When `SESSION_AGENT_CACHE.popitem(last=False)` evicts an old agent, its
`_session_db` is dropped on the floor and only released when GC eventually
finalizes the agent — which on a long-running server may be never.
